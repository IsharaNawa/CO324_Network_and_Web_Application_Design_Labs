# CO324 Lab 6: Stateful Systems

## Objective
At the end of the lab you should be able to
* Define services and messages using the Protocol Buffers interface definition language.
* Implement gRPC clients and servers.
* Consider API semantics during API implementations.
* Implement stateful applications.

## Preparation
Same as Lab 05 and Lab 04.

## Instructions
* Use **only grpcio and built-in modules** in Python 3 to complete these exercises.
* Put the solutions to coding exercises for the files in `src/` directory.
* **Put your E Number as a comment** in top of each source file.
* **DO NOT** change any code in `test/` directory.
